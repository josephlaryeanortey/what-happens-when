To improve this technical documentation, I propose the following pull request:

    Add Clarification on Key Press Events:
        Provide additional explanation regarding how different operating systems handle key press events, specifically focusing on Windows, OS X, and GNU/Linux.
        Clarify the distinction between physical keyboards and virtual keyboards (e.g., touch screens).

    Enhance ARP Process Explanation:
        Expand on the ARP process to include more details about how ARP requests are broadcasted and how ARP replies are handled in different network environments (e.g., directly connected, hub, switch).

    Improve Socket Opening Explanation:
        Provide more context on the significance of TCP segments and how they are handled at each layer of the OSI model.
        Clarify the role of source and destination ports in socket communication.

    Update Protocol Default Ports Information:
        Mention that while HTTP defaults to port 80 and HTTPS to port 443, these ports can be overridden in the URL or specified explicitly.

    Include Reference Links:
        Add relevant hyperlinks to external sources for further reading on topics like ARP, OSI model, TCP/IP, etc.

    Grammar and Clarity Improvements:
        Review the text for grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or unclear explanations and make necessary corrections for better readability.

This pull request aims to enhance the clarity and completeness of the technical documentation, providing readers with a more thorough understanding of the topics covered.
